Vappio startup sequence
--------------------------

Each script or symlink in the platform or node types directories will
be invoked by run-parts and should not contain any '.' or file
extensions

At startup, files named S## will be invoked with a single argument, start.

At shutdown, files named K## will be invoked with a single argument, stop.

Two specially named script are used by the system to detect the
platform or node types dynamically at system boot.

/etc/vappio/vp-detect-platform - returns a single platform name

Example platforms: ec2, magellan, xen, vmware, vbox

New platforms can be added by creating a directory with platform
startup and shutdown scripts and adding detection logic to
detect_platform

/etc/vappio/$platform/vp-detect-nodetype - returns one or more node types

Example node types: master, exec

New node types can be added by creating a directory with startup and
shutdown scripts for the node type. 

The platform and node type services are automatically started at boot
time from the service /etc/init/vappio_detect

Command line utilities are also provided to start and stop a platform
or node type

/opt/vappio-scripts/vp-start-platform
/opt/vappio-scripts/vp-stop-node
/opt/vappio-scripts/vp-stop-platform
